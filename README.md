Here’s a sample `README.md` file for your machine learning pipeline project, based on the contents of your uploaded notebooks (`entire_pipeline.ipynb` and `pridect pipeline.ipynb`):

# 🧠 Titanic Survival Prediction Pipeline

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline for predicting survival on the Titanic dataset using scikit-learn. It includes preprocessing, modeling, hyperparameter tuning, and model deployment using a pickled pipeline.

## 🛠️ Features

* Preprocessing with `ColumnTransformer` for numerical and categorical data
* Handling missing values using `SimpleImputer`
* Categorical encoding using `OneHotEncoder`
* Model training with `DecisionTreeClassifier`
* Hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV`
* End-to-end pipeline using `Pipeline`
* Model serialization using `pickle`
* Simple test prediction with input reshaping

---

## 🧪 Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Install required Python packages:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

3. Run the `entire_pipeline.ipynb` to train and export the pipeline.
4. Use `pridect pipeline.ipynb` to test prediction with user input.

---

## 💡 Example Prediction

The test script (`pridect pipeline.ipynb`) uses this input:

```python
test_input2 = np.array([2, 'male', 31.0, 0, 0, 10.5, 'S'], dtype=object).reshape(1, 7)
pipe.predict(test_input2)
```

### Output:

```
array([0])  # Model prediction (0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived)
```

---

## ⚠️ Warnings

You might see this warning:

```
UserWarning: X does not have valid feature names, but SimpleImputer was fitted with feature names
```

This is safe and occurs because the model was trained with DataFrames (with feature names) but predictions use raw arrays. You can suppress it or pass a DataFrame with matching columns.

---

## ✅ To-Do

* Add web interface for predictions (e.g., Streamlit or Flask)
* Improve preprocessing for better generalization
* Add more models or ensemble methods

---

## 📜 License

This project is open-source and free to use for educational purposes.
